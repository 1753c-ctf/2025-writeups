> Talk to Mr. Fox! I'm sure he will share a flag with you.

## Discovery

Not really hard to find, since to need to interact with Mr. Fox right from the beginning. He is a bot supporting the event and he advertise himself as a little helper who can do a few things for us like registering the team etc.

## Solution

What Mr. Fox is not advertising out loud is that he can provide you with a test flag. Asking him for one will result in flag being scored by your team.
