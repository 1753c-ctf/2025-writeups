## Discovery

There is a photo attached to the challenge showing a girl with beutiful hair of amazing colour, and a bunch of pink birds that seems to be flamingos.

## Solution

1. Start with the obvious: where are flamingos found?
The first logical step is to identify popular locations around the world where flamingos are commonly seen. While places like Africa, South America, and parts of Asia are known for their exotic flamingo habitats, there are also spots in Europe and the Mediterranean that host them seasonally.

2. Look beyond the flamingos – the background matters.
One important detail stands out: the background does not look particularly exotic. Instead of vast natural landscapes or tropical flora, you see city buildings and a fairly urban skyline. This observation significantly narrows down the possible locations.

3. Match cityscapes and structures.
While browsing through known flamingo habitats, you might notice similarities. The distinctive buildings in the background start to look familiar. After checking a few image results, it becomes clear that the cityscape in the distance matches only a few known places — and one of them is Larnaca in Cyprus. The buildings in the photo line up almost perfectly with those found near Larnaca Salt Lake, a known flamingo spot.

4. Use Google Lens for confirmation.
To back up your research, you can use Google Lens or a similar reverse image search tool. Uploading the image there usually gives helpful context or related images, and in this case, it confirms your hunch – Larnaca Salt Lake shows up among the top suggestions.
