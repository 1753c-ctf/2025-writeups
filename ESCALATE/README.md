Logging in to the cat site automatically gets the `user role`, it allows you to browse the cat site and post comments. However, the application has a vulnerability: Mass Assignment. This means that the role assignment is not checked and the user can change it.That is, by providing a session token we are able to overwrite our role.

```bash

```
## Admin

However, with the second flag, i.e. changing the role from `user` to `admin`, the application has a dotless vulnerability. When you specify a new role as `admÄ±n`, Unicode case collisions happen and it is read as `ADMIN`.
