# Sanity Check

ðŸª¦ Category: _FORENSIC_

> One of our agents never returned from his mission. We've found that he died captured by enemies. All that we got left are these backup files. Not sure how to get to them, but I think he used one of his family member names to secure it.


## Discovery

Challenge includes a folder name backup with some files and folders. The structure is nothing too familiar, but after googling all the folder names "data index keys locks snapshot" first result is documentation to a backup tool named Restic.

After installing restic we can try to open the backup with following command

```bash
$ restic -r backup snapshots
```

but what we get in return is

```bash
enter password for repository:
```

Well, kind of expected. Now how do we crack it open?

## Solution

The obvious first thought is, that since these files are on our local machine we try to bruteforce it. This repository seems to do what we want https://github.com/juergenhoetzel/restic-bruteforce.

This tool needs to be built from source using attached meson configuration

```bash
$ meson setup builddir && cd builddir && meson compile
```

Then we can grab neessary encryption information from backup folder

```bash
$ jq < keys/608e4fa104ef6b656198bc470f980ab147662d6dd7032855b3d04ce399fc9a0b 
{
  "created": "2025-04-06T17:07:05.806434091Z",
  "username": "root",
  "hostname": "f834fc6fec8b",
  "kdf": "scrypt",
  "N": 32768,
  "r": 8,
  "p": 7,
  "salt": "vTvkPe/DpBiHfQ4Hp4loPfnx4Wu1vZR0ZCtf1SMCki5j8xaFXH7uopJkhdBrwNlYEqpjr5TH6Gh3zDgYEIRUCg==",
  "data": "53yWN39gmUZSiqOgdI4JxZ/9xxBhwP/zW144NqYFRvtObK2FwVQDHQpQt0uQNxvEqhHeKL45eLj/HH+aK6LXu/OKWII3Olk+5v3Sfvu0whCngKDFFDgWfPPMgT5oErujVTg2FEe+gu3a2OKRlQNBg9fT/Q6DJKd18MnzAhy57l71NSs9AtjoOjgVngxa/0q2MKzUALEiQC66UTL03vVZYw=="
}
```

and use that data to run code cracking.

We just need a good dictionary of names. First one that google suggests is https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huntergregal/wordlists/refs/heads/master/names.txt. Let's try this one.

Now we need to run restic-bruteforce and be a little patient as it's not that fast:

```bash
$ time ./restic-brute -v -n 32768 -r 8 -p 7 vTvkPe/DpBiHfQ4Hp4loPfnx4Wu1vZR0ZCtf1SMCki5j8xaFXH7uopJkhdBrwNlYEqpjr5TH6Gh3zDgYEIRUCg== 53yWN39gmUZSiqOgdI4JxZ/9xxBhwP/zW144NqYFRvtObK2FwVQDHQpQt0uQNxvEqhHeKL45eLj/HH+aK6LXu/OKWII3Olk+5v3Sfvu0whCngKDFFDgWfPPMgT5oErujVTg2FEe+gu3a2OKRlQNBg9fT/Q6DJKd18MnzAhy57l71NSs9AtjoOjgVngxa/0q2MKzUALEiQC66UTL03vVZYw== <names.txt
```

Which outputs this and after a few minutes finds a password:

Christopher, eh? Now we can try to look into restic repository

```bash
$ restic -r backup --password-command "echo Christopher" snapshots
repository 83c0e793 opened (version 2, compression level auto)
created new cache in /Users/lukaszwronski/Library/Caches/restic
ID        Time                 Host        Tags        Paths  Size
------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------
1 snapshots
```

That show's us just one snapshot and we can check what files it contains with this command

```bash
$ restic -r backup --password-command "echo Christopher" ls 389a509c
repository 83c0e793 opened (version 2, compression level auto)
[0:00] 100.00%  4 / 4 index files loaded
snapshot 389a509c of [/flag] at 2025-04-06 18:02:12.182221879 +0000 UTC by root@AgentAlpha filtered by []:
/flag1.txt
/flag5.txt
```

Flag files sounds like a jackpot, but when printing them we get a fake flag?

```bash
$ restic -r backup --password-command "echo Christopher" dump 389a509c /flag1.txt
repository 83c0e793 opened (version 2, compression level auto)
[0:00] 100.00%  4 / 4 index files loaded
1753c{fake%      

$ restic -r backup --password-command "echo Christopher" dump 389a509c /flag5.txt
repository 83c0e793 opened (version 2, compression level auto)
[0:00] 100.00%  4 / 4 index files loaded
_flag}%  
```

Looks like flags 2 - 4 are missing. Fortunately Restic allows to restore deleted snapshots if only someone forgot to rune `prune` command. We can recover and then rebuild index lke this

```bash
$ restic -r backup --password-command "echo Christopher" recover

repository 83c0e793 opened (version 2, compression level auto)
load index files
[0:00] 100.00%  1 / 1 index files loaded
load 4 trees
[0:00] 100.00%  4 / 4 trees loaded
load snapshots
done

found 3 unreferenced roots
saved new snapshot d4efceea

$ restic -r backup --password-command "echo Christopher" repair index
```

and then when running snapshot list we see 2, not just 1 snapshot.

```bash
repository 83c0e793 opened (version 2, compression level auto)
ID        Time                 Host                          Tags        Paths     Size
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
389a509c  2025-04-06 20:02:12  AgentAlpha                                /flag     16 B
d4efceea  2025-04-06 20:25:21  MacBook-Air.local  recovered   /recover
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2 snapshots
```

Now ls command shows us all recovered files

```bash
$ restic -r backup --password-command "echo Christopher" ls d4efceea
repository 83c0e793 opened (version 2, compression level auto)
[0:00] 100.00%  1 / 1 index files loaded
snapshot d4efceea of [/recover] at 2025-04-06 20:25:21.437775 +0200 CEST by hacker@MacBook-Air.local filtered by []:
/405d9e38
/405d9e38/flag1.txt
/405d9e38/flag2.txt
/405d9e38/flag3.txt

/c9663b07
/c9663b07/flag1.txt
/c9663b07/flag4.txt
/c9663b07/flag5.txt
```

and grabbing remaing flag parts we can get the full flag: `1753c{faked_my_own_death_to_save_the_flag}`
